# osTicket plugin: Mentioner

Parses messages for Mentions, and adds users/agents emails or names as collaborators on a ticket.

Concept pinched as lazily as possible from: http://osticket.com/forum/discussion/comment/115623

Checkout into /include/plugins/mentioner and Install as per normal osTicket Plugins

Now new thread entries (mail/messages/notes) will be checked for words starting with an @ symbol and have those words checked for Agent's usernames.
